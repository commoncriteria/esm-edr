  <chapter title="Introduction" id="int">
    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview"> This Protection Profile (PP) Module describes the
      security functionality of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems in terms of 
      CC, and defines functional and assurance requirements for such products. EDR is
      enterprise management software that collects endpoint host data to detect potentially
      unauthorized activity on endpoints and to enable threat hunting and other incident response
      actions to remediate malicious behaviors. These requirements cover basic security characteristics 
      and behaviors for EDR products; the platform on which the EDR runs may be a physical or virtual 
      Operating System (OS), and on-premises or in a cloud environment. <h:br/>
      
      <h:br/> EDR products rely on additional software running on the endpoint, called the Host
      Agent, to communicate commands or policy changes and to receive endpoint host data. Security
      requirements for the Host Agent are addressed in the separate <cite linkend="bibHAGT"/>
      Module. Evaluation of an EDR system will require evaluations of different system components 
      consisting of EDR and <cite linkend="bibHAGT"/>. Each evaluation must satisfy the requirements 
      in both the [MOD_EDR_V1.0] or [MOD_HA_V1.0] in addition its Base-PP [PP APP V1.3].
      
      
      Evaluation of an EDR system will require multiple evaluations of different system
      components: one against this ESM EDR Module for the EDR and at least one other
      against the <cite linkend="bibHAGT"/> Module with its base <cite linkend="bibAppPP"/>. <h:br/>
      <h:br/> There are two primary architectural categories addressed by requirements in this
      PP-Module, as seen in Figure 1.
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>Endpoints communicate over the Internet to an EDR hosted by a cloud service provider (Software as a Service).</h:li>
        <h:li>Endpoints communicate with an on-premises EDR in a hub and spoke network model.</h:li>

      <subsection title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary"> The TOE boundary for the EDR encompasses
        all the software from the TOE vendor that represents the server or enterprise management
        side of the EDR System. This will typically, but not always, be software running behind a
        web application or dashboard, and possibly with other software services running to send and
        receive data with a Host Agent. The EDR may also make use of a database to store collected
        and analyzed data. Any database software itself is outside the scope of the TOE, as is any
        web server software used to serve a web application or dashboard, and the underlying
        operating system or cloud platform. The figure below shows EDR (right) communicating with
        its Host Agent (left) over an untrusted network. <h:br/> The requirements for the Host Agent
        are not covered in this Module, however it is expected that an ESM System will evaluate
        against this ESM EDR Module for the EDR and the <cite
          linkend="bibHAGT"/> Module with its base <cite linkend="bibAppPP"/>. <figure

        communications with trusted remote file reputation or threat intelligence services is
        relevant to overall EDR System security but is also outside the scope of evaluation.

                HTTPS can be used in this trusted channel. <h:br/><h:br/> This requirement is to
                ensure that the transmission of any logs, process lists, system information, etc,
                when commanded, or at configurable intervals, is properly protected. This trusted
                channel also protects any commands and policies sent by the EDR to
                the Host Agent. Either the Host Agent or the EDR System is able to
                initiate the connection. <h:br/><h:br/> This trusted channel protects both the

                connection between an unenrolled Host Agent and the EDR during the
                enrollment operation. Different protocols can be used for these two connections, and
                the description in the TSS should make this difference clear.

            <title>The EDR shall digitally sign commands and policies sent to the
              Host Agent in accordance with FCS_COP.1.1(3). </title>
            <note role="application"> The intent of this requirement is to cryptographically tie any policy updates or
            commends sent to the Host Agent as being from the EDR. This is not to 
            protect the policies in transit as they are already protected by FTP_DIT_EXT.1.1. 
		    The digital signature used to sign policies or commands
            must be selected in FCS_COP.1.1(3). The use of this requirement makes FCS_COP.1.1(3)
            from the Base-PP a mandatory requirement.</note>

              <TSS>The evaluator shall check to ensure that the TSS describes how all commands and policies are signed.</TSS>
              <Guidance>The evaluator shall review the operational guidance and ensure that the
                EDR any configuration information for policy signing is included.
              </Guidance>
              <Tests>The evaluator shall select any one remediation function documented in the
                administrative guide (e.g., terminate process), and execute that command
                while capturing traffic. The evaluator shall review captured network traffic and
                verify that a digital signature was sent along with the coinciding command or policy update.
                The EDR may need to be configured in a manner to disable transport
                encryption for this test or the network capture tool may need to be
                configured with the private key such that decrypted traffic can be made
                available to the evaluator.
