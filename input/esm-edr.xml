    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
      The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to describe the security functionality of Endpoint Detection and 
      Response (EDR) systems in terms of [CC], and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products.
      An EDR system is managment software that collects endpoint host data for the purpose of detecting malicous activity
      and enabling response actions to remediate the malicious behaviors. These requirements cover basic security 
      characteristics and behaviors for EDR management systems that are hosted in a cloud, on-premises, or a hybrid. 
      The platform on which the EDR system runs may be physical, virtual, or part of a cloud environment.
      <h:br />
      The security requirements for the host agent are addressed in the separate <cite linkend="bibHAGT"/> 
      Protection Profile. Evaluation of an EDR system will require evaluation against the ESM-EDR PP and 
      the <cite linkend="bibHAGT"/>  PP.
      <h:br />
      There are three primary architectural categories for an EDR system addressed by requirements in this PP and 
      as seen in the figure below. 
      <h:li>Endpoints communicate over the Internet to an EDR cloud service. Often refered to as Software as a Service (SaaS)</h:li>
      <h:li>Endpoints communicate with an on-premises EDR server in a hub and spoke network model. </h:li>
      <h:li>Endpoints communicate with other Endpoints and ultimately an on-premises EDR server in a 
        ring based network model (for example: peer-to-peer).</h:li>

              <h:b>AES-CBC Known Answer Tests</h:b>
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
		There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs), described below. In all KATs, the
              plaintext, ciphertext, and IV values shall be 128-bit blocks. The results from each
              test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to
              the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness, the
              evaluator will compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same
              inputs to a known good implementation. <h:ul>
                <h:li>KAT-1. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  a set of 10 plaintext values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from
                  AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext using a key value of all zeros and an IV
                  of all zeros. Five plaintext values shall be encrypted with a 128-bit all-zeros
                  key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a 256-bit all- zeros key. To test
                  the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will perform the same test as
                  for encrypt, using 10 ciphertext values as input and AES-CBC decryption.</h:li>
                <h:li>KAT-2. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  a set of 10 key values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC
                  encryption of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all
                  zeros. Five of the keys shall be 128-bit keys, and the other five shall be 256-bit
                  keys. To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will perform
                  the same test as for encrypt, using an all-zero ciphertext value as input and
                  AES-CBC decryption.</h:li>
                <h:li>KAT-3. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  the two sets of key values described below and obtain the ciphertext value that
                  results from AES encryption of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value
                  and an IV of all zeros. The first set of keys shall have 128 128-bit keys, and the
                  second set shall have 256 256-bit keys. Key i in each set shall have the leftmost
                  i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N]. To test the
                  decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply the two sets of key
                  and ciphertext value pairs described below and obtain the plaintext value that
                  results from AES-CBC decryption of the given ciphertext using the given key and an
                  IV of all zeros. The first set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 128 128-bit
                  key/ciphertext pairs, and the second set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 256
                  256-bit key/ciphertext pairs. Key i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be
                  ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N]. The ciphertext value in
                  each pair shall be the value that results in an all-zeros plaintext when decrypted
                  with its corresponding key.</h:li>
                <h:li>KAT-4. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  the set of 128 plaintext values described below and obtain the two ciphertext
                  values that result from AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext using a 128-bit
                  key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros and using a 256-bit key value of
                  all zeros with an IV of all zeros, respectively. Plaintext value i in each set
                  shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for
                  i in [1,128].</h:li>
              </h:ul>
	      <h:br/>
	      To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will perform the
              same test as for encrypt, using ciphertext values of the same form as the plaintext in
              the encrypt test as input and AES-CBC decryption.
	      </h:p>
              <h:b>AES-CBC Multi-Block Message Test</h:b>
	      <h:p>
              The evaluator will test the encrypt functionality by encrypting an i-block
              message where 1 &lt; i &#x2264; 10. The evaluator will choose a key, an IV and plaintext
              message of length i blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with
              the chosen key and IV. The ciphertext shall be compared to the result of encrypting
              the same plaintext message with the same key and IV using a known good implementation.
              The evaluator will also test the decrypt functionality for each mode by decrypting an
              i-block message where 1 &lt; i &#x2264;10. The evaluator will choose a key, an IV and a
              ciphertext message of length i blocks and decrypt the message, using the mode to be
              tested, with the chosen key and IV. The plaintext shall be compared to the result of
              decrypting the same ciphertext message with the same key and IV using a known good
              implementation.

	    <h:p>
	      <h:b>AES-CBC Monte Carlo Tests</h:b>
	    </h:p>
	    <h:p>
	      The evaluator will test the encrypt
              functionality using a set of 200 plaintext, IV, and key 3- tuples. 100 of these shall
              use 128 bit keys, and 100 shall use 256 bit keys. The plaintext and IV values shall be
              128-bit blocks. For each 3-tuple, 1000 iterations shall be run as follows:
              <h:pre>
              # Input: PT, IV, Key
              for i = 1 to 1000:
                if i == 1:
                      CT[1] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, IV, PT)
                      PT = IV
                else:
                  CT[i] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, PT) 
                  PT = CT[i-1]
              </h:pre>The
              ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration (i.e., CT[1000]) is the result for that
              trial. This result shall be compared to the result of running 1000 iterations with the
              same values using a known good implementation. 
	    </h:p>
	    <h:p>
	      The evaluator will test the
              decrypt functionality using the same test as for encrypt, exchanging CT and PT and
              replacing AES-CBC-Encrypt with AES-CBC-Decrypt.

              <h:b>AES-GCM Monte Carlo Tests</h:b>
              <h:p/>The evaluator will test the authenticated encrypt functionality of AES-GCM for
              each combination of the following input parameter lengths: <h:ul>
                <h:li>128 bit and 256 bit keys</h:li>
                <h:li>Two plaintext lengths. One of the plaintext lengths shall be a non-zero integer
                  multiple of 128 bits, if supported. The other plaintext length shall not be an
                  integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported.</h:li>
                <h:li>Three AAD lengths. One AAD length shall be 0, if supported. One AAD length shall
                  be a non-zero integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One AAD length shall not
                  be an integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported.</h:li>
                <h:li>Two IV lengths. If 96 bit IV is supported, 96 bits shall be one of the two IV
                  lengths tested.</h:li>
              </h:ul>The evaluator will test the encrypt functionality using a set of 10 key,
              plaintext, AAD, and IV tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above and
              obtain the ciphertext value and tag that results from AES-GCM authenticated encrypt.
              Each supported tag length shall be tested at least once per set of 10. The IV value
              may be supplied by the evaluator or the implementation being tested, as long as it is
              known. 
	    </h:p>
	    <h:p>


	      The evaluator will test the decrypt functionality using a set of 10 key,
              ciphertext, tag, AAD, and IV 5-tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above
              and obtain a Pass/Fail result on authentication and the decrypted plaintext if Pass.
              The set shall include five tuples that Pass and five that Fail. 
	    </h:p>
	    <h:p>
	      The results from
              each test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs
              to the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness,
              the evaluator will compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the
              same inputs to a known good implementation.

	      <h:p>
              The evaluator will test the generation-encryption and decryption-verification
              functionality of AES-CCM for the following input parameter and tag lengths: <h:ul>
                <h:li>128 bit and 256 bit keys</h:li>
                <h:li>Two payload lengths. One payload length shall be the shortest supported payload
                  length, greater than or equal to zero bytes. The other payload length shall be the
                  longest supported payload length, less than or equal to 32 bytes (256 bits).
                </h:li>
                <h:li>Two or three associated data lengths. One associated data length shall be 0, if
                  supported. One associated data length shall be the shortest supported payload length,
                  greater than or equal to zero bytes. One associated data length shall be the longest
                  supported payload length, less than or equal to 32 bytes (256 bits). If the
                  implementation supports an associated data length of 2
                  16 bytes, an associated data length of 216 bytes shall be tested.
                </h:li>
                <h:li>Nonce lengths. All supported nonce lengths between 7 and 13 bytes, inclusive, shall

              </h:ul>
              To test the generation-encryption functionality of AES-CCM, the evaluator will perform the
              following four tests: 
	      <testlist>
		<test> For EACH supported key and associated data length and ANY supported
                  payload, nonce and tag length, the evaluator will supply one key value, one nonce
                  value and 10 pairs of associated data and payload values and obtain the resulting
                  ciphertext.
		</test>
		<test>For EACH supported key and payload length and ANY supported associated
                  data, nonce and tag length, the evaluator will supply one key value, one nonce value
                  and 10 pairs of associated data and payload values and obtain the resulting ciphertext.
		</test>

                <test>For EACH supported key and nonce length and ANY supported associated
                  data, payload and tag length, the evaluator will supply one key value and 10
                  associated data, payload and nonce value 3-tuples and obtain the resulting ciphertext.
                </test>
                <test>For EACH supported key and tag length and ANY supported associated data,
                  payload and nonce length, the evaluator will supply one key value, one nonce value
                  and 10 pairs of associated data and payload values and obtain the resulting ciphertext.
                </test>
	      </testlist>
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
              To determine correctness in each of the above tests, the evaluator will compare the
              ciphertext with the result of generation-encryption of the same inputs with a known good
              implementation. 
	      </h:p>

              To test the decryption-verification functionality of AES-CCM, for EACH combination of
              supported associated data length, payload length, nonce length and tag length, the evaluator
              shall supply a key value and 15 nonce, associated data and ciphertext 3-tuples and obtain
              either a FAIL result or a PASS result with the decrypted payload. The evaluator will supply
              10 tuples that should FAIL and 5 that should PASS per set of 15. 
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
              Additionally, the evaluator will use tests from the IEEE 802.11-02/362r6 document
              “Proposed Test vectors for IEEE 802.11 TGi”, dated September 10, 2002, Section 2.1 AESCCMP

                  tested.
                </h:li>
              </h:ul>
              The evaluator will test the encrypt functionality using a set of 10 key, plaintext, AAD, and
              IV tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above and obtain the ciphertext value
              and tag that results from AES-GCM authenticated encrypt. Each supported tag length shall be
              tested at least once per set of 10. The IV value may be supplied by the evaluator or the

              <h:p>
                Per NIST SP 800-131A, SHA-1 for generating digital signatures
                is no longer allowed, and SHA-1 for verification of digital signatures is strongly
                discouraged as there may be risk in accepting these signatures. 
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
                SHA-1 is currently required in order to comply with <linkref linkend="FCS_TLSC_EXT.1"/>
                and, depending on selections, <linkref linkend="FCS_DTLS_EXT.1"/>.
                Vendors are strongly encouraged to implement updated protocols that support the SHA-2
                family; until updated protocols are supported, this PP allows support for SHA-1
                implementations in compliance with SP 800-131A. 
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
                The intent of this requirement is to specify the hashing function. 
                The hash selection must support the message digest
                size selection. The hash selection should be consistent with the overall strength of
                the algorithm used. 
              </h:p>
            </note>
            <aactivity>
              <h:p>
                The evaluator will check that the association of the hash function with
                other application cryptographic functions (for example, the digital signature
                verification function) is documented in the <abbr linkend="TSS"/>. 
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
                The <abbr linkend="TSF"/>
                hashing functions can be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the
                byte-oriented mode. In this mode the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> only hashes messages that
                are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e., the length (in bits) of the message
                to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is the bit-oriented mode. In this mode
                the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> hashes messages of arbitrary length. As there are different
                tests for each mode, an indication is given in the following sections for the
                bit-oriented vs. the byte-oriented testmacs. The evaluator will perform all of the
                following tests for each hash algorithm implemented by the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> and
                used to satisfy the requirements of this PP.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
                The following tests require the
                developer to provide access to a test application that provides the evaluator with
                tools that are typically not found in the production application.<testlist>
                  <test>Short Messages Test (Bit oriented Mode) - The evaluator will generate an input set
                    consisting of m+1 messages, where m is the block length of the hash algorithm. The
                    length of the messages range sequentially from 0 to m bits. The message text shall
                    be pseudorandomly generated. The evaluator will compute the message digest for each of
                    the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are
                    provided to the <abbr linkend="TSF"/>.</test>
                  <test>Short Messages Test (Byte oriented Mode) - The evaluator will generate an input set
                    consisting of m/8+1 messages, where m is the block length of the hash algorithm.
                    The length of the messages range sequentially from 0 to m/8 bytes, with each
                    message being an integral number of bytes. The message text shall be
                    pseudorandomly generated. The evaluator will compute the message digest for each of
                    the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are

                  <test>Selected Long Messages Test (Bit oriented Mode) - The evaluator will generate an input
                    set consisting of m messages, where m is the block length of the hash algorithm.
                    The length of the <h:i>i</h:i>th message is 512 + 99&#x22c5;i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The message
                    text shall be pseudorandomly generated. The evaluator will compute the message digest
                    for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the
                    messages are provided to the <abbr linkend="TSF"/>.</test>
                  <test>Selected Long Messages Test (Byte oriented Mode) - The evaluator will generate an
                    input set consisting of m/8 messages, where m is the block length of the hash
                    algorithm. The length of the <h:i>i</h:i>th message is 512 + 8&#x22c5;99&#x22c5;i, 
                    where 1 ≤ i ≤ m/8. The message text shall be pseudorandomly generated. 
                    The evaluator will compute
                    the message digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is
                    produced when the messages are provided to the <abbr linkend="TSF"/>.</test>
                  <test>Pseudorandomly Generated Messages Test -  This test is for byte-oriented
                    implementations only. The evaluator will randomly generate a seed that is n bits long,
                    where n is the length of the message digest produced by the hash function to be
                    tested. The evaluator will then formulate a set of 100 messages and associated digests
                    by following the algorithm provided in Figure 1 of [SHAVS]. The evaluator will then
                    ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided to the
                    <abbr linkend="TSF"/>.

address threats identified in <secref linkend="threats"/>. 
The Security Functional Requirements (<abbr linkend="SFR"/>s) in <secref linkend="SFRs"/>
are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. 
The PP identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (<abbr linkend="SAR"/>s) to frame 
the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the 
evaluation and performs independent testing.

      This section lists the set of <abbr linkend="SAR"/>s from CC part 3

      <abbr class="expanded" title="Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility">ITSEF</abbr>
      will obtain the EDR, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
      the EDR. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the evaluation activities
      contained within <secref linkend="req"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
      EDR. The evaluation activities that are captured in <secref linkend="req"/> also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the EDR is compliant
      with the PP.

		  The "evaluation evidence required by the SARs" in this PP is limited to the
              information in the <abbr linkend="ST"/> coupled with the guidance provided to
              administrators and users under the AGD requirements. By ensuring that the <abbr

              consistent in the <abbr linkend="ST"/> and in the AGD guidance (as done in the
              evaluation activity for ALC_CMC.1), the evaluator implicitly confirms the information
              required by this component. Life-cycle support is targeted aspects of the developer’s
              life-cycle and instructions to providers of applications for the developer’s devices,
              rather than an in-depth examination of the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> manufacturer’s
              development and configuration management process. This is not meant to diminish the
              critical role that a developer’s practices play in contributing to the overall
              trustworthiness of a product; rather, it’s a reflection on the information to be made
              available for evaluation.

              developing applications for the developer’s platform. For each of these development

              are invoked (e.g., compiler and linker flags). The evaluator will ensure that this documentation
              also includes an indication of whether such protections are on by default, or have to
              be specifically enabled. The evaluator will ensure that the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> is
              uniquely identified (with respect to other products from the <abbr linkend="TSF"/>
              vendor), and that documentation provided by the developer in association with the
              requirements in the <abbr linkend="ST"/> is associated with the <abbr linkend="TSF"/>

      <subsection id="ate" title="Class ATE: Tests">Testing is specified for functional aspects of
        the system as well as aspects that take advantage of design or implementation weaknesses.
        The former is done through the ATE_IND family, while the latter is through the AVA_VAN
        family. At the assurance level specified in this PP, testing is based on advertised
        functionality and interfaces with dependency on the availability of design information. One
        of the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified in the
        following requirements. <a-component id="ate_ind.1"
          name="Independent Testing – Conformance (ATE_IND.1)"> Testing is performed to confirm the
          functionality described in the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> as well as the administrative
          (including configuration and operational) documentation provided. The focus of the testing
          is to confirm that the requirements specified in <secref linkend="SFRs"/> being met,
          although some additional testing is specified for SARs in <secref linkend="SARs"/>. The
          evaluation activities identify the additional testing activities associated with these

              aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
              shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
              in the report. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in the <cite

	      While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an evaluation activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the <abbr linkend="ST"/> is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                <abbr linkend="ST"/>, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the <abbr linkend="ST"/> are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the EDR and its
              platform.
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results.
	      </h:p><h:p>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the “pass” result.
