    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
      This Protection Profile (PP) describes the security functionality of Endpoint Detection and 
      Response (EDR) systems in terms of [CC], and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products.
      EDR is enterprise management software that collects endpoint host data to detect potentially
      unauthorized activity on endpoints and to enable threat hunting and other incident
      response actions to remediate malicious behaviors. These requirements cover basic security
      characteristics and behaviors for an EDR that is hosted in a cloud, on-premises, or a hybrid
      infrastructure. The platform on which the EDR runs may be a physical or virtual Operating System (OS)
      on-premises or in a cloud environment.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      EDR relies on additional software running on the endpoint, called the Host Agent, to communicate
      commands or policy changes to and to receive endpoint host data from. 
      Security requirements for the Host Agent are addressed in the separate <cite linkend="bibHAGT"/> 
      Extended Package. Evaluation of an EDR System will require multiple evaluations of different system components:
      one against this ESM EDR PP for the EDR server software and at least one other against the
      <cite linkend="bibHAGT"/> EP with its base <cite linkend="bibAPPSW"/> PP.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      There are three primary architectural categories addressed by requirements in this PP, as seen in the figure below. 
      <h:li>Endpoints communicate over the Internet to an EDR cloud service (Software as a Service).</h:li>
      <h:li>Endpoints communicate with an on-premises EDR in a hub and spoke network model.</h:li>
      <h:li>Endpoints communicate with other endpoints, ultimately being orchestrated by an on-premises EDR in a 
        ring based network model (e.g., peer-to-peer).</h:li>

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
      <subsection title="TOE Boundary" id="toeboundary">
          The TOE boundary for the EDR encompasses all the software from the TOE vendor that represents
          the server or enterprise management side of the EDR System. This will typically, but not always, be
          software running behind a web application or dashboard, and possibly with other software services running
          to send and receive data with a Host Agent. The EDR may also make use of a database to store collected
          and analyzed data. Any database software itself is outside the scope of the TOE, as is any web server software
          used to serve a web application or dashboard, and the underlying operating system or cloud platform.
          The figure below shows EDR (right) communicating with its Host Agent (left) over an untrusted network.
          <h:br />
          The requirements for the Host Agent are not covered in this PP, however it is expected that 
          an EDR System will evaluate once against this ESM EDR PP for the EDR and at least once more
          against the <cite linkend="bibHAGT"/> EP with its base <cite linkend="bibAPPSW"/> PP.

      <subsection title="TOE Platform" id="TOEplatform">
        The TOE platform, which consists of the Operating System or Cloud platform on which 
        the EDR software executes, is outside the scope of evaluation. At the same time, 
        the security of the EDR relies upon it.
        <h:br />
        Any communications with trusted remote file reputation or threat intelligence services
        is relevant to overall EDR System security but is also outside the scope of evaluation.

              The reference for the tests contained in this section is The Random Number Generator
              Validation System (RNGVS). The evaluators shall conduct the following two tests. Note 
              that the "expected values" are produced by a reference implementation of the algorithm 
              that is known to be correct. Proof of correctness is left to each Scheme.
              <testlist>
                <test>The evaluators shall perform a Variable Seed Test. The evaluators shall
                  provide a set of 128 (Seed, DT) pairs to the <abbr title="TOE Security Functionality" linkend="TSF">TSF</abbr> RBG function, 
                  each 128 bits. The evaluators shall also provide a key (of the length appropriate 
                  to the AES algorithm) that is constant for all 128 (Seed, DT) pairs. The DT value 
                  is incremented by 1 for each set. The seed values shall have no repeats within
                  the set. The evaluators ensure that the values returned by the 
                  <abbr title="TOE Security Functionality" linkend="TSF">TSF</abbr> match the expected values.
                </test>
                <test>
                  The evaluators shall perform a Monte Carlo Test. For this test, they supply
                  an initial Seed and DT value to the <abbr title="TOE Security Functionality" linkend="TSF">TSF</abbr> RBG function; each of 
                  these is 128 bits. The evaluators shall also provide a key (of the length 
                  appropriate to the AES algorithm) that is constant throughout the test. The 
                  evaluators then invoke the <abbr title="TOE Security Functionality" linkend="TSF">TSF</abbr> RBG 10,000 times, with the DT 
                  value being incremented by 1 on each iteration, and the new seed for the

                  Algorithms, Section 3. The evaluators ensure that the 10,000th value produced

                <test>
                  The evaluator shall perform 15 trials for the RNG implementation. If the RNG is
                  configurable, the evaluator shall perform 15 trials for each configuration. The
                  evaluator shall also confirm that the operational guidance contains appropriate
                  instructions for configuring the RNG functionality.
                  <h:br />
                  If the RNG has prediction resistance enabled, each trial consists of (1) 
                  instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) generate a 
                  second block of random bits (4) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the 
                  second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall generate 
                  eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three 
                  are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the instantiate 
                  operation. The next two are additional input and entropy input for the first call 
                  to generate. The final two are additional input and entropy input for the second
                  call to generate. These values are randomly generated. “generate one block of 
                  random bits” means to generate random bits with number of returned bits equal to 
                  the Output Block Length (as defined in NIST SP 800-90A).
                  <h:br />
                  If the RNG does not have prediction resistance, each trial consists of (1) 
                  instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) reseed, (4) 
                  generate a second block of random bits (5) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies 
                  that the second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall 
                  generate eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The 
                  next three are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the 
                  instantiate operation. The fifth value is additional input to the first call to
                  generate. The sixth and seventh are additional input and entropy input to the call 
                  to reseed. The final value is additional input to the second generate call.
                  <h:br />
                  The following paragraphs contain more information on some of the input values to 
                  be generated/selected by the evaluator.
                  <h:br />
                  <h:b>Entropy input:</h:b> the length of the entropy input value must equal the seed length.
                  <h:br />
                  <h:b>Nonce:</h:b> If a nonce is supported (CTR_DRBG with no Derivation Function does not use 
                  a nonce), the nonce bit length is one-half the seed length. 
                  <h:br />
                  <h:b>Personalization string:</h:b> The length of the personalization string must be 
                  less then or equal to seed length. If the implementation only supports one 
                  personalization string length, then the same length can be used for both values. 
                  If more than one string length is support, the evaluator shall use personalization 
                  strings of two different lengths. If the implementation does not use a 
                  personalization string, no value needs to be supplied. 
                  <h:br />
                  <h:b>Additional input:</h:b> the additional input bit lengths have the same defaults 
                  and restrictions as the personalization string lengths.

              platform that provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory 
              products.

              <h:b>Key Establishment Schemes</h:b><h:p/>
              The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the key establishment schemes supported by 
              the TOE using the applicable tests below. 
              <h:br />
              <h:b>SP800-56A Key Establishment Schemes</h:b><h:p/>
              The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement schemes 
              using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement 
              scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme 
              according to the specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the 
              calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the calculation of the 
              derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation 
              is supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the components of key confirmation have 
              been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes the 
              parsing of the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag.
              <h:br />
              <indent>
                <h:b>Function Test</h:b><h:p/>
                The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement 
                schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors 
                from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each supported 
                key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type, and, if supported, 
                key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester shall generate 10 
                sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or 
                the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, 
                ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested.
                <h:br />
                The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static and/or 
                ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other 
                Information <h:i>(OtherInfo)</h:i> and TOE id fields.
                <h:br />
                If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall obtain only 
                the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret.
                <h:br />
                The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given 
                scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value, 
                derive the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from 
                these values.
                <h:br />
                If key confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each implemented 
                approved MAC algorithm.
                <h:br />
                <h:b>Validity Test</h:b><h:p/>
                The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid and 
                invalid key agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this test, the 
                evaluator shall obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions included in the 
                SP800-56A key agreement implementation to determine which errors the TOE should 
                be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors 
                consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves, the 
                evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs 
                used in the KDF, such as the OtherInfo and TOE id fields.
                <h:br />
                The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE 
                recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: 
                the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the OtherInfo field, the data to be 
                MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial (only ECC) 
                public key validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors in both parties’ 
                static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the TOE’s static private key 
                to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key validation function and/or the partial 
                key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test vectors shall remain 
                unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results (they should 
                pass).
                <h:br />
                The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme 
                using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results with 
                the results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects these 
                errors.
                <h:br />

              <h:b>SP800-56B Key Establishment Schemes</h:b><h:p/>
              The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes whether the TOE acts as a sender, a 
              recipient, or both for RSA-based key establishment schemes.
              <h:br />
              If the TOE acts as a sender, the following assurance activity shall be performed to ensure the 
              proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based key establishment 
              scheme:
              <h:br />
              <indent>
                To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known 
                good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of 
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key confirmation 
                if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation 
                is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is 
                supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector shall 
                include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional input 
                parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key confirmation is 
                incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the evaluator shall 
                perform a key establishment encryption operation on the TOE with the same inputs 
                (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use the MacKey from 
                the test vector instead of the randomly generated MacKey used in normal operation) 
                and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the ciphertext in the test 
                vector.

              <h:br />
              If the TOE acts as a receiver, the following assurance activities shall be performed to ensure 
              the proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based key establishment

                To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known 
                good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of 
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with our without key 
                confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key 
                confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is 
                supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector 
                shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData), any 
                additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key 
                confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the 
                evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption operation on the TOE and 
                ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to the 
                plaintext keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is 
                incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that 
                the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector.

              <h:br />
              The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE handles decryption errors. In 
              accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the TOE must not reveal the particular 
              error that occurred, either through the contents of any outputted or logged error message or 
              through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP is supported, the evaluator shall create separate 
              contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of the three decryption error checks described in 
              NIST Special Publication 800-56B section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt 
              results in an error, and ensure that any outputted or logged error message is identical for each. 
              If KTS-KEM-KWS is supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext 
              values that trigger each of the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special 
              Publication 800-56B section 7.2.3.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in an error,

              <h:b>AES-CBC Known Answer Tests</h:b>
              <h:p />There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs), described below. In
              all KATs, the plaintext, ciphertext, and IV values shall be 128-bit
              blocks. The results from each test may either be obtained by the
              evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer
              and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness,
              the evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those obtained
              by submitting the same inputs to a known good implementation. 
              <h:ul>
                <h:li>KAT-1. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the
                  evaluator shall supply a set of 10 plaintext values and obtain
                  the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC encryption of the
                  given plaintext using a key value of all zeros and an IV of all
                  zeros. Five plaintext values shall be encrypted with a 128-bit
                  all-zeros key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a

                  encrypt, using 10 ciphertext values as input and AES-CBC
                  decryption.</h:li>

                  shall be 256-bit keys. To test the decrypt functionality of
                  AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for
                  encrypt, using an all-zero ciphertext value as input and AES-CBC
                  decryption.</h:li>
                <h:li>KAT-3. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the
                  evaluator shall supply the two sets of key values described below
                  and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES encryption
                  of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of
                  all zeros. The first set of keys shall have 128 128-bit keys, and

              </h:ul>To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator
              shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using ciphertext values

              AES-CBC decryption.

              <h:b>AES-CBC Multi-Block Message Test</h:b>
              <h:p />The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality by
              encrypting an i-block message where 1 &lt; i &lt;= 10. The
              evaluator shall choose a key, an IV and plaintext message of length
              i blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with
              the chosen key and IV. The ciphertext shall be compared to the
              result of encrypting the same plaintext message with the same key
              and IV using a known good implementation. The evaluator shall also
              test the decrypt functionality for each mode by decrypting an
              i-block message where 1 &lt; i &lt;=10. The evaluator shall choose
              a key, an IV and a ciphertext message of length i blocks and
              decrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen
              key and IV. The plaintext shall be compared to the result of
              decrypting the same ciphertext message with the same key and IV
              using a known good implementation. AES-CBC Monte Carlo Tests The
              evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using a set of 200
              plaintext, IV, and key 3- tuples. 100 of these shall use 128 bit
              keys, and 100 shall use 256 bit keys. The plaintext and IV values
              shall be 128-bit blocks. For each 3-tuple, 1000 iterations shall be
              run as follows: 
              <h:pre>
                # Input: PT, IV, Key
                for i = 1 to 1000:
                if i == 1:
                CT[1] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, IV, PT)
                PT = IV
                else:
                CT[i] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, PT) 
                PT = CT[i-1]
              </h:pre>The ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration (i.e.,
              CT[1000]) is the result for that trial. This result shall be
              compared to the result of running 1000 iterations with the same
              values using a known good implementation.
              <h:br />The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using the
              same test as for encrypt, exchanging CT and PT and replacing
              AES-CBC-Encrypt with AES-CBC-Decrypt. 
              <h:br />
              <h:b>AES-GCM Monte Carlo Tests</h:b>
              <h:p />The evaluator shall test the authenticated encrypt
              functionality of AES-GCM for each combination of the following
              input parameter lengths: 
              <h:ul>

              Per NIST SP 800-131A, SHA-1 for generating digital signatures is no
              longer allowed, and SHA-1 for verification of digital signatures is strongly discouraged as
              there may be risk in accepting these signatures.
              <h:br/>
              SHA-1 is currently required in order to comply with <linkref linkend="FCS_TLSC_EXT.1"/>. If
              FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.1 is included in the ST, the hashing algorithms selection for FCS_COP.1(2)
              must match the hashing algorithms used in the mandatory and selected cipher suites of
              FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.1. Vendors are strongly encouraged to implement updated protocols that
              support the SHA-2 family; until updated protocols are supported, this PP allows support for
              SHA-1 implementations in compliance with SP 800-131A.
              <h:br/>
              The intent of this requirement is to specify the hashing function. The hash selection must
              support the message digest size selection. The hash selection should be consistent with the
              overall strength of the algorithm used (for example, SHA 256 for 128-bit keys).
            </note>
            <aactivity>
              The evaluator shall check that the association of the hash function with other
              application cryptographic functions (for example, the digital signature verification
              function) is documented in the TSS.
              <h:br/>
              The <abbr title="TOE Security Functionality" linkend="TSF">TSF</abbr> hashing functions can be implemented in one of two 
              modes. The first mode is the byte-oriented mode. In this mode the <abbr title="TOE Security Functionality" linkend="TSF">TSF</abbr> 
              hashes only messages that are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e., the length 
              (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is the 
              bit-oriented mode. In this mode the <abbr title="TOE Security Functionality" linkend="TSF">TSF</abbr> hashes messages of arbitrary 
              length. As there are different tests for each mode, an indication is given in the 
              following sections for the bit-oriented vs. the byte-oriented testmacs. The evaluator 
              shall perform all of the following tests for each hash algorithm implemented by the 
              <abbr title="TOE Security Functionality" linkend="TSF">TSF</abbr> and used to satisfy the requirements of this PP.

              The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test application
              that provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found in the production

                  by following the algorithm provided in Figure 1 of [SHAVS]. The evaluators then

The Security Functional Requirements (<abbr linkend="SFR"/>s) in <secref linkend="SFRs"/>
are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. 
The PP identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (<abbr linkend="SAR"/>s) to frame

      <abbr class="expanded" title="Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility">ITSEF</abbr>

      the EDR. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the evaluation activities
      contained within <secref linkend="req"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
      EDR. The evaluation activities that are captured in <secref linkend="req"/> also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the EDR is compliant

		  The evaluator will prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing
              aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
              shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
              in the report. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in the <cite
                linkend="bibCEM"/> and the body of this PP’s evaluation activities. 
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an evaluation activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the <abbr linkend="ST"/> is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                <abbr linkend="ST"/>, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the <abbr linkend="ST"/> are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the EDR and its
              platform.
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results.
	      </h:p><h:p>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the “pass” result.

      <subsection id="ava" title="Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment">For the first generation of
        this protection profile, the evaluation lab is expected to survey open sources to discover
        what vulnerabilities have been discovered in these types of products. In most cases, these
        vulnerabilities will require sophistication beyond that of a basic attacker. Until
        penetration tools are created and uniformly distributed to the evaluation labs, the
        evaluator will not be expected to test for these vulnerabilities in the <abbr linkend="EDR"
        />. The labs will be expected to comment on the likelihood of these vulnerabilities given
        the documentation provided by the vendor. This information will be used in the development
        of penetration testing tools and for the development of future protection profiles.

	      The evaluator will generate a report to document their
              findings with respect to this requirement. This report could physically be part of the
              overall test report mentioned in ATE_IND, or a separate document. The evaluator
              performs a search of public information to find vulnerabilities that have been found
              in similar applications with a particular focus on network protocols the application
              uses and document formats it parses.

              For each vulnerability found, the evaluator
              either provides a rationale with respect to its non-applicability, or the evaluator
              formulates a test (using the guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm the
              vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack vector
              needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. If exploiting the vulnerability
              requires expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a test would not
              be suitable and an appropriate justification would be formulated.

    appendix must be included. The third type (in <appref linkend="objective"/> are components that
    are not required in order to conform to this PP, but will be included in the baseline
    requirements in future versions of this PP, so adoption by vendors is encouraged. Note that the
    ST author is responsible for ensuring that requirements that may be associated with those in
