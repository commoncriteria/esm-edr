	<section title="Background and Purpose" id="purpose">
		This section sets the context for not only the ESR, but what is 
		expected of the resulting Protection Profile (PP). The intent is 
		that the remaining sections provide succinct statements that 
		highlight the relevant aspects to be addressed by the Technical 
		Community (TC) constructing the PP. Here, the authors provide a 
		narrative that introduces the reader to the problem being solved, 
		and presents key aspects that support or guide the TC, and may
		elaborate on subtleties not apparent in the “bulleted” high level
		statements.

	<section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">
		EDR automatically detects malicious system activities and behaviors.
		<ul>
			<li>Continuously records significant events occurring on managed systems.</li>
			<li>Automatically identifies, reports, and investigates potential malicious activity.</li>
			<li>Enables access through a management console query interface.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section title="Resources to be protected" id="resourcesprotected">
    	<ul>
			<li>Sensitive data in transit.</li>
			<li>Sensitive data stored locally by endpoint agent.</li>
			<li>Sensitive data stored by common management server.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section title="Attacker access" id="attackeraccess"> 
	<ul>
		<li>An attacker is assumed to attempt attacks from the following vantage points:
			<ul>
				<li>The network across which the application engages in communication, both actively
				and passively.</li>
				<li>The platform on which the application is installed, though as an unprivileged
				subject.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>An attacker has an arbitrary amount of time to analyze the behavior of the application,
		its interaction with its host device or platform, and/or the data it transmits over the network.</li>
	</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section title="Essential Security Requirements" id="requirements">
		The following are the essential security requirements expected to be implemented by an
		EDR within the established scope.
		<ul>
			<li>Implementation does not impair authorized system operations (e.g., updating, patching,
			scanning, business software usage) or native platform security mechanisms.</li>
			<li>Encrypt all data in transit and data at rest with FIPS 140-2 compliant cryptographic
			modules.
				<ul>
					<li>Securely store and transmit data in a manner that ensures the confidentiality,
					integrity, availability, and source authenticity of the data.</li>>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Provide the ability to automatically capture, record, and analyze a range of endpoint
			parameters and events, including:
				<ul>
					<li>User activity - privileged or unprivileged.</li>
					<li>Network activity - file transfers, connections, destination URLs, IPs, traffic
					type, and encryptiono used.</li>
					<li>Processes and services - scheduled and manual starts and stops, process tree,
					libraries loaded, and file associations.</li>
					<li>Software changes - driver or software installation, uninstallation, patching,
					and modification.</li>
					<li>Peripheral connections - wired and wireless connections to peripheral devices.</li>
					<li>File activity - files created, opened, closed, saved, modified, moved, or deleted.</li>
					<li>In-memory activity - activity within memory associated with known, malicious
					processes (e.g., mutexes, named pipes).</li>
					<li>Hardware changes - peripheral device detection, removal, or modification.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Provide automated analyses and visualization of an incident; include an incident timeline
			and an initial assessment of severity or impact.</li>
			<li>Support for user-specific delegation of who can access or view collected endpoint data.</li>
			<li>Automatically report detection of potentially malicious events to a common management
			server and support a non-proprietary, standard data format (e.g., STIX).
				<ul>
					<li>Report all potential incidents encountered during high latency or disconnected
					periods.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Provide response and isolation capabilities upon detection of a potentially malicious
			event, including:
				<ul>
					<li>Endpoint quarantine/isolation.</li>
					<li>Process kill.</li>
					<li>File or artifact capture.</li>
					<li>Blacklist of known bad executables.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Provide an API or similar means for integration into custom or third-party reporting
			software or existing security program workflows.</li>
		</ul>

	<section title="Assumptions" id="assumptions">
		Simply put, this section presents the aspects of the product and 
		its	intended environment that can be assumed to hold true. This 
		will provide additional scope on the resulting PP.

		The following assumptions are made for the operating system product and its operational
		environment:
		<ul>
			<li>The underlying platform is physically protected, to a large extent. The hardware
				that the product manages is secured by defensive measures that make physical attacks
				impractical for most attackers. At the same time, casual passersby might attempt to
				trivially access the system. </li>
			<li>The product implements some security-relevant functionality that does not require
				evaluation (e.g., network time synchronization, process scheduling, and virtual
				memory management including process separation). </li>
			<li>Depending on configuration and capability, the product may or may not be: <ul>
					<li>configuration-managed by the enterprise</li>
					<li>bound to directory services to support multi-user login</li> </ul>
			</li>
			<li> The product runs application software developed by a third-party. The applications are
				not intentionally developed to be malicious, but can contain inadvertent coding
				errors. These errors introduce risk that control of an application may be seized by
				a malicious entity. The product shall confine these applications within the originally
				designated operating environment. </li>
			<li>The platform is connected to a network. For purposes of sending/receiving data, to
				include software updates, the platform is connected to other entities. Other
				entities on the network are not inherently trustable. </li>
			<li>Administrators are not malicious in nature.</li>
			<li> Users are not malicious in nature, though they may inadvertently or intentionally engage in risky behavior. </li>
		</ul>

	<section title="Optional Extensions" id="extensions"> 
		Additional security functionality that may
		be appropriate for some use cases, and can be expressed in extensions to this document,
		includes: 
		<ul>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section title="Outside the TOE's Scope" id="outsidescope">
		The following list contains items that are explicitly out-of-scope for any evaluation
		against the product PP <ul>
			<li>The hardware or firmware of the underlying platforms.</li>
			<li>The host operating system of the endpoint.</li>
		</ul>
